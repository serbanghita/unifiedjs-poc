<p>title: On Retrospectives</p>
<h2>date: "2018-03-16T11:53:30.994Z"</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a program, new employees will make mistakes while in their learning
curve that will require assistance and intervention from other team
members, slowing everyone down. (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898">The Lean Startup</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to find the bad processes, not bad people, and remedy them
accordingly. The act of reflecting on your just-finished project is not
naturally a high priority.</p>
<p>While <strong>safety</strong> is ultimately the responsability of <strong>all the participants</strong>
in a retrospective, the facilitator needs to initiate, monitor and
control the safety. Part of being safe means knowing that there will be
no retribution for being honest. Trust must be established and maintained
during a retrospective.</p>
<p>Managers must participate, contribute and learn rather than dominate
the discussions.</p>
<p>A retrospective can turn into complaint session rather than learning
session and, by virtue of that, the information is necessarily highly
regarded.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> everyone affected by the problem is in the room during the analysis of the root cause</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> everyone means: who discovered, who worked, who debugged, management involved into escalating, decision makers</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> <em>"shame on us for making it easy to make that mistake"</em></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> environment and culture must be based on mutual trust and empowerment</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> face the unwanted truth</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> executive leadership needs to sponsor the analysis process (buy-in from a team leader or manager)</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> appoint a master for moderating the meeting</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> keep away from tangents, stick to the main thread, keep meeting short</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p><strong>Beginning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Define success" - metrics, comparison with previous or similar
projects, previous experiences</li>
<li>"Create safety" - establish rules: no interrupt, don't judge, own
perspective, no jokes</li>
<li>"Artifacts contest" - bring your artifacts: coding standards,
documents, mockups, notes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Middle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Develop a timeline" - activity cards</p>
<ul>
<li>"Offer appreciation"</li>
<li>"Mining the timeline for gold"</li>
<li>"Passive analogy"</li>
<li>"Repair damage through play"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Cross-affinity teams" - the goal is to get proposals</li>
<li>"Making the magic happen" - small and independent action items</li>
</ul>

<h2>Downsides</h2>
<ul>
<li>sitting</li>
<li>no natural light</li>
<li>
<p>time-boxed - <em>"C'mon be creative, you have 30 minutes"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>5-member team meeting takes at least 30 minutes = 5 * 5 minutes per person + 5 min intro</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>struggle to remember</li>
<li>focus on action items - <em>"Typical sunny day thinking"</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>Learn from each other</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer this methodology in the beginning when the team members
don't know each other well and the process of learning is in full sail.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>"What have you learned this iteration that we could benefit from immediately?"</em></li>
<li>Each team member gets 5 minutes speech.</li>
<li>No interruptions during the speeches.</li>
<li>Take feedback in good faith.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Five Whys</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Technique developed by Taiichi Ohno the father of the Toyota Production System.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the root of every seemingly <em>technical problem</em> is a <em>human problem</em>. Five Whys provides an opportunity
to discover what that human problem might be.</p>
<p>The root cause moves away from a technical fault and toward a human error and we can trace these
problems back to <strong>training</strong> or <strong>company manual</strong> or <strong>documentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Some basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each of the 5 questions asked, appoint a person in charge with the improvement (the answer)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting feedback</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Though this is a more formal approach to retrospective, it can trigger
innovation by acknowledging the goals and sponsoring them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What are you proud of having done last year, and what do you think you could have done better?</li>
<li>What 3 things would you do to improve your team?</li>
<li>What 3 things would you look at improving Atlassian and/or its work environment?</li>
<li>If you were going to set yourself goals for the next six months, what would they be?</li>
</ul>

<p>An alternative would be to add the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Incident_Technique">Critical Incident Technique</a> adapted to software environment.
When someone is asked to give feedback on a colleague, make them remember the last incidents and how they responded.</p>
